# --- Section 2: [Command Line Arguments] ---
#

# Use the command line argument "--cfg-file=/etc/another-config.conf" to specify a different config
# file. All other options in this file can also be used as command line arguments, or set using
# environment variables, overriding the corresponding config file values. See `--help` for details
# on how to configure using flags and/or environment variables.


#
# --- Section 3: [Basic Settings Documentation] ---
#

# mount-point: The path where BeeGFS is mounted.


#
# --- Section 3.1: [Logging Settings] ---
#

# Logging configuration must be specified under [log].

# level: Adjust the logging verbosity. Supported levels:
# 0 - Fatal Only (not recommended).
# 1 - Fatal + Error
# 2 - Warn + Error + Fatal
# 3 - Info + Warn + Error + Fatal
# 4, 5 - Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal
# Note: Levels above 3 might decrease performance.

# type: Defines the logger type. This can either be "syslog" to send log messages to the general
# system logger, "logfile", "stderr", or "stdout". If set to "logfile" logs will be written to the
# below file and rotated based on the provided settings. 

# file: The path to the desired log file when logType is "logfile". As needed the directory and all
# parent directories will be created.

# max-size: When type is set to "logfile" this is the maximum size of the file in megabytes before
# it is rotated.

# num-rotated-files: When type is "logfile" the maximum number old file(s) to keep when max-size is
# reached and the log is rotated.


#
# --- Section 3.2: [Server Settings] ---
#

# Server configuration must be specified under [server]. These setting affect how BeeGFS Remote
# connects to this Sync node to apply configuration and assign work requests.

# address: The IP address and port where the server will listen formatted like 0.0.0.0:0000.

# tls-cert-file: The PEM encoded X509 certificate that provides the identity of the server.

# tls-key-file: The private key file belonging to tls-cert-file.

# tls-disable: Set to disable TLS encryption and send all gRPC messages in clear text over the
# network. Discouraged for production as it exposes data to potential interception and tampering.


#
# --- Section 3.3: [Manager Settings] ---
#

# Manager configuration must be specified under [manager]. These settings affect how work requests
# are tracked and stored internally by the Sync node.

# journal-db: The path where a journal of all work requests assigned to this node will be kept. This
# is used to resume outstanding work requests after the Sync node restarts or crashes.

# job-db: The path where a database of all jobs with active work requests on this node is stored.

# active-work-queue-size: The number of work requests to keep in memory. Set this as high as
# possible, ideally large enough it can contain all active work requests assigned to this node.

# num-workers: The number of workers used to execute work requests in parallel. By default this is
# automatically set to the number of CPUs.


#
# --- Section 3.4: [Remote Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for the BeeGFS Remote node must be specified under [remote]. Most configuration such
# as the address/port are synced automatically from the Remote node (see Worker node settings on the
# Remote node), however some per-worker configuration such as TLS settings may need to be specified.
# These settings affect how the Sync node connects to the Remote node to provide work results.

# tls-cert-file: Specify the path to a certificate used to verify the identity of the BeeGFS Remote
# node and to encrypt communication. If this parameter is left empty, the application will use the
# system's default certificate pool. This parameter is ignored if tls-disable is set.
# Example: /etc/beegfs/cert.pem

# tls-disable-verification: Set to true to skip verifying the Remote TLS certificate. This allows
# traffic to be encrypted, but puts the client at risk of a man-in-the-middle attack since it cannot
# verify the Remote node is the expected one.

# tls-disable: Set to disable TLS encryption and send all gRPC messages in clear text over the
# network. Discouraged for production as it exposes data to potential interception and tampering.

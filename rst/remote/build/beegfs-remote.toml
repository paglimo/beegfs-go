# --- Section 2: [Command Line Arguments] ---
#

# Use the command line argument "--cfg-file=/etc/another-config.conf" to specify a different config
# file. All other options in this file can also be used as command line arguments, or set using
# environment variables, overriding the corresponding config file values. See `--help` for details
# on how to configure using flags and/or environment variables.


#
# --- Section 3: [Basic Settings Documentation] ---
#

# mount-point: The path where BeeGFS is mounted.


#
# --- Section 3.1: [Management Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for the BeeGFS management node must be specified under [management]. This
# configuration is used to verify licensing and cannot be updated after the application is started.

# address: The IP address and gRPC port for the BeeGFS management node. 

# tls-disable-verification: Set to true to skip verifying the management TLS certificate. This
# allows traffic to be encrypted, but puts the client at risk of a man-in-the-middle attack since it
# cannot verify the management node is the expected one.

# tls-cert-file: Specify the path to a certificate used to verify the identity of the Management
# node and to encrypt communication. If this parameter is left empty, the application will use the
# system's default certificate pool. This parameter is ignored if tls-disable is set. 
# Example: /etc/beegfs/cert.pem

# tls-disable: Set to disable TLS encryption and send all gRPC messages in clear text over the
# network. Discouraged for production as it exposes data to potential interception and tampering.

# use-http-proxy: Set to automatically use any proxy configured globally or via environment
# variables for gRPC communication to the Management node. Will be propagated to Sync nodes.

# auth-file: The file containing the shared secret for BeeGFS connection authentication.

# auth-disable: Disable BeeGFS connection authentication (not recommended).


#
# --- Section 3.2: [Logging Settings] ---
#

# Logging configuration must be specified under [log].

# level: Adjust the logging verbosity. Supported levels:
# 0 - Fatal Only (not recommended).
# 1 - Fatal + Error
# 2 - Warn + Error + Fatal
# 3 - Info + Warn + Error + Fatal
# 4, 5 - Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal
# Note: Levels above 3 might decrease performance.

# type: Defines the logger type. This can either be "syslog" to send log messages to the general
# system logger, "logfile", "stderr", or "stdout". If set to "logfile" logs will be written to the
# below file and rotated based on the provided settings. 

# file: The path to the desired log file when logType is "logfile". As needed the directory and all
# parent directories will be created.

# max-size: When type is set to "logfile" this is the maximum size of the file in megabytes before
# it is rotated.

# num-rotated-files: When type is "logfile" the maximum number old file(s) to keep when max-size is
# reached and the log is rotated.


#
# --- Section 3.3: [Server Settings] ---
#

# Server configuration must be specified under [server]. These setting affect how the BeeGFS
# command-line tool (CTL) and worker nodes connect to the the Remote service to submit and
# manage jobs and work requests.

# address: The IP address and port where the server will listen formatted like 0.0.0.0:0000.

# tls-cert-file: The PEM encoded X509 certificate that provides the identity of the server.

# tls-key-file: The private key file belonging to tls-cert-file.

# tls-disable: Set to disable TLS encryption and send all gRPC messages in clear text over the
# network. Discouraged for production as it exposes data to potential interception and tampering.


#
# --- Section 3.4: [Job Settings] ---
#

# Job configuration must be specified under [job]. These settings affect how jobs are tracked and
# stored internally by Remote.

# path-db: Path where the database tracking jobs for each path will be created/maintained.

# request-queue-depth: Number of requests that can be made to before new requests are blocked until
# the existing requests have been assigned to worker nodes.

# min-job-entries-per-rst: This many jobs for each RST configured for a particular path is
# guaranteed to be retained. At minimum this should be set to 1 so we always know the last sync
# result for an RST.

# max-job-entries-per-rst: Once this threshold is exceeded, older jobs will be deleted
# (oldest-to-newest) until the number of jobs equals the min-job-entries-per-rst.


#
# --- Section 4: [Worker Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for each worker should be specified under [[worker]] and includes all configuration
# that should apply to a particular worker. Multiple workers can be specified by adding additional
# [[worker]] sections.

# id: A unique identifier that should not be changed after the worker node first starts. This is
# used internally to track what work is assigned to a particular node.

# name: User-friendly name used to help identify the worker in logs and other output. This can be
# changed at any time.

# type: The type of worker node, currently the only supported worker type is 'beesync'.

# address:  The IP/hostname and port where the worker node is listening for work requests.

# tls-cert-file: Specify the path to a certificate used to verify the identity of the worker node
# and to encrypt communication. If this parameter is left empty, the application will use the
# system's default certificate pool. This parameter is ignored if tls-disable is set. 
# Example: /etc/beegfs/cert.pem

# tls-disable-verification: Set to true to skip verifying the worker's TLS certificate. This allows
# traffic to be encrypted, but puts the client at risk of a man-in-the-middle attack since it cannot
# verify the worker is the expected one.

# tls-disable: Set to disable TLS encryption and send all gRPC messages in clear text over the
# network. Discouraged for production as it exposes data to potential interception and tampering.

# use-http-proxy: Set to automatically use any proxy configured globally or via environment
# variables for gRPC communication to the worker node.


#
# --- Section 4.1: [Advanced Worker Settings] ---
#

# The following optional configuration can also be specified in a [[worker]] section, but does not
# typically need to be modified. Worker nodes like BeeGFS Sync receive most of their configuration
# from the Remote node and the parameters in this section primarily affect Remote and worker node
# synchronization. Generally the default settings are acceptable for most environments, and simply
# affect how the system recovers from various error conditions, and do not affect performance when
# the system is optimal.

# max-reconnect-back-off: When a worker node is not available, the Remote node will try to reconnect
# to the worker node with an exponential backoff to avoid spamming connection attempts. This is the
# maximum time to wait before attempting to reconnect. Setting this too low will waste CPU cycles
# trying to reconnect while a worker is offline. Setting this too high will add extra delay
# reconnecting and bringing a worker node back online after it restarts.

# disconnect-timeout: When attempting to disconnect from a node, such as when the Remote node is
# shutting down, how long to wait for outstanding RPCs to gracefully complete before any remaining
# requests are forcibly cancelled. This primarily affects how long it may take to stop the Remote
# node in a worst case scenario where a worker node is not responding. If this is increased the
# TimeoutStopSec in the BeeGFS remote system unit may also need to be increased.

# send-retries: When sending work requests to a worker node, how many times to retry if the node is
# not yet in a state where it is able to accept requests. This typically only happens immediately
# after a worker node is restarted, if the Remote node has not yet detected the node has restarted
# and the worker node has not yet received configuration from the Remote node.

# retry-interval: When sending a work request to a worker and it is not ready, how long to wait
# before resending the request. In total the Remote node will wait send-retries*retry-interval
# before giving up and retrying the work request on a different worker.

# heartbeat-interval: There are two ways the Remote node detects a worker node is offline. The first
# is when it attempts to send a worker node a work request, if there is an error it will
# automatically place the node offline and attempt to reconnect and/or apply its configuration. The
# second is by sending periodic heartbeats to the worker to verify it is online, has received the
# latest configuration, and is ready to accept work requests. The heartbeat mechanism is primarily
# used to detect issues with a worker node when the system is otherwise idle so the worker is able
# to resume existing work requests. This is because after a worker restarts it waits for the Remote
# node to first check in, assign it configuration, and tell it what to do with any outstanding work
# requests. Without the heartbeat mechanism the worker node would remain idle and not resume any of
# its outstanding work requests.


#
# --- Section 6: [General Remote Storage Target Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for each Remote Storage Target (RST) should be specified under
# [[remote-storage-target]] and includes all configuration that should apply to a particular RST.
# Multiple RSTs can be specified by adding additional [[remote-storage-target]] sections.

# id: A unique identifier for the RST. This is the ID that is set on entries in BeeGFS to indicate
# they should be synchronized with this target. It is also how to indicate a specific RST when
# pushing or pulling a file to that RST as a one time operation. Generally IDs should not be changed
# after they are initially set unless there are no remaining jobs or entries referencing the old ID.

# name: User-friendly name used to help identify the RST in logs and other output. This can be
# changed at any time.

# policies: A map of policies that determines how jobs for this RST are executed regardless of type.
#
# FastStartMaxSize: The number of bytes after which push/pull operations are split into multiple
# parts and distributed across multiple worker nodes (if available). For example when uploading to
# an S3 bucket, Amazon generally recommends as object sizes approach 100MB, a multipart upload
# should be used instead of uploading the object in a single operation, thus 104857600 is a
# reasonable policy to set (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html).


#
# --- Section 6.1: [S3 Remote Storage Target Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for RSTs that are backed by an S3 bucket should be specified using "s3.<key-name>"
# under a [[remote-storage-target]] section. Mixing configuration for different RST types in the
# same RST section will result in an error.

# s3.endpoint-url: The full endpoint URL for the S3 bucket. The URL format depends on the S3
# provider. For example:
#
# * Minio: http://<hostname>:<port>
# * Amazon Web Services: https://<BUCKET_NAME>.s3.<REGION>.amazonaws.com
# * Oracle Cloud (OCI): https://<ENDPOINT>.compat.objectstorage.<REGION>.oraclecloud.com

# s3.region: The region where the S3 bucket is located. Valid options depend on the particular S3
# provider. For example:
#
# * Minio: minio
# * Amazon Web Services: us-east-1  
# * Oracle Cloud: us-chicago-1

# s3.bucket: The name of the S3 bucket.

# s3.access-key: An access key that has permission to access the specified S3 bucket.

# s3.secret-key: The secret key associated with the provided access key used together to
# authenticate requests to the specified S3 provider.

# s3.partitionid: Generally the partition ID does not need to specified and the default partition
# for the S3 provider can be used. If your S3 bucket is in a specialized region such as AWS GovCloud
# this may need to be specified/

# --- Section 2: [Command Line Arguments] ---
#

# Use the command line argument "--cfg-file=/etc/anotherconfig.conf" to specify a different config
# file for beegfs-watch. All other options in this file can also be used as command line arguments,
# or set using environment variables, overriding the corresponding file values. See `beegfs-watch
# --help` for details on how to configure Watch using flags and/or environment variables.


#
# --- Section 3: [Basic Settings Documentation] ---
#

# Where indicated, Watch configuration can be updated without restarting Watch by updating
# this file then running `systemctl reload beegfs-watch`.


#
# --- Section 3.1: [Logging Settings] ---
#

# Logging configuration must be specified under [log]. Except the log level, this configuration
# cannot be updated after the application is started.

# level: Adjust the logging verbosity. Supported levels:
# 0 - Fatal Only (not recommended).
# 1 - Fatal + Error
# 2 - Warn + Error + Fatal
# 3 - Info + Warn + Error + Fatal
# 4, 5 - Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal
# Note: Levels above 3 might decrease performance.

# type: Defines the logger type. This can either be "syslog" to send log messages to the general
# system logger, "logfile", "stderr", or "stdout". If set to "logfile" logs will be written to the
# below file and rotated based on the provided settings. 

# file: The path to the desired log file when logType is "logfile". As needed the directory and all
# parent directories will be created.

# max-size: When type is set to "logfile" this is the maximum size of the file in megabytes before
# it is rotated.

# num-rotated-files: When type is "logfile" the maximum number old file(s) to keep when max-size is
# reached and the log is rotated.


#
# --- Section 3.2: [Management Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for the BeeGFS management service must be specified under [management]. This
# configuration is used to verify licensing and cannot be updated after the application is started.

# address: The IP address and gRPC port for the BeeGFS management service.

# tls-disable-verification: Set to true to skip verifying the management TLS certificate. This
# allows traffic to be encrypted, but puts the client at risk of a man-in-the-middle attack since it
# cannot verify the management service is the expected one.

# tls-cert-file: Specify the path to a certificate used to verify the identity of the Management
# node and to encrypt communication. If this parameter is left empty, the application will use the
# system's default certificate pool. This parameter is ignored if tls-disable is set. 
# Example: /etc/beegfs/cert.pem

# tls-disable: Set to disable TLS encryption and send all gRPC messages in clear text over the
# network. Discouraged for production as it exposes data to potential interception and tampering.

# use-http-proxy: Set to automatically use any proxy configured globally or via environment
# variables for gRPC communication to the Management node.

# auth-file: The file containing the shared secret for BeeGFS connection authentication.

# auth-disable: Disable BeeGFS connection authentication (not recommended).

#
# --- Section 3.3: [[Metadata Settings]] ---
#

# Configuration for the BeeGFS metadata service Watch is listening to must be specified under
# [[metadata]]. Currently only a single metadata service can be specified. This configuration cannot
# be updated after the application is started.

# event-log-target: The path where the BeeGFS metadata service expected to log events to a unix
# socket (should match sysFileEventLogTarget in beegfs-meta.conf).

# event-buffer-size: How many events to keep in memory if the BeeGFS metadata service sends events
# to Watch faster than they can be sent to subscribers, or a subscriber is temporarily disconnected.
# Worst case memory usage is approximately (9KiB x event-buffer-size). Note the events stored in the
# Watch event buffer are stored using protocol buffers, which are slightly larger than the raw
# events sent from the Metadata server. 9KiB per event is a conservative "worst case" estimate.
#
# The event-buffer-size should be set taking into consideration the number of events that may be
# stored in the on-disk metadata event queue as determined by sysFileEventPersistSize in
# beegfs-meta.conf. Events stored in the metadata event queue can range in size from ~72 bytes
# (e.g., creating a file in the root directory with a single letter name) up to ~8,287 bytes (e.g.,
# renaming a file with a 4096 character name, the max in Linux). For example a 1GiB (1,048,576 KiB
# or 1,073,741,824 bytes) on-disk metadata event queue could store between 129,569 and 14,913,080
# events depending on their size.
#
# Ideally the event-buffer-size is set to be larger than the number of events in the metadata event
# queue, which depends on the average event size. If this is unknown a good rule of thumb is to use
# an average event size of 256 bytes then calculate the event-buffer-size using:
# (sysFileEventPersistSize * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) / 256. For example if sysFileEventPersistSize=1g
# then event-buffer-size could be set to 4,194,304 for a maximum memory footprint of 36 GiB with
# 8,287 byte events. With this configuration for a metadata server generating 10,000 events per
# second, a subscriber could be disconnected for around 419 seconds before events would be dropped.

# event-buffer-gc-frequency: After how many new events should unused buffer space be reclaimed
# automatically. This should be set taking into consideration the buffer size. More frequent garbage
# collection will negatively impact performance, whereas less frequent garbage collection risks
# running out of memory and dropping events. A good starting point is 1/10 the event-buffer-size.


#
# --- Section 3.4: [Handler Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for subscriber handlers must be specified under [handler]. This configuration
# applies to all subscribers and may be updated after the application has started.

# max-reconnect-backoff: When a connection cannot be made to a subscriber subscriber reconnection
# attempts will be made with an exponential backoff. This is the maximum time in seconds between
# reconnection attempts to avoid increasing the backoff timer forever.

# max-wait-for-response-after-connect: When a subscriber connects/reconnects wait this long for the
# subscriber to acknowledge the sequence ID of the last event it received successfully. This
# prevents sending duplicate events if the connection was disrupted unexpectedly. 

# poll-frequency: How often subscribers should poll the metadata buffer for new events (causes more
# CPU utilization when idle).


#
# --- Section 4.1: [Basic Subscriber Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for each subscriber must be specified under a new [[subscriber]] header.
# Configuration options in this setting should be specified for each [[subscriber]] they apply to.
# Subscribers may be added, removed, and updated after the application has started.

# id: The `id` option is used to keep track of what events should/have been sent to a particular
# subscriber. This means all other subscriber configuration (including the type) can be changed
# without losing events intended for a particular subscriber as long as the ID remains the same. 

# name: The `name` option no special significance and is intended to help users identify this
# subscriber in logs and configuration files.

# type: The `type` option is used to specify what protocol should be used to communicate with this
# subscriber. Additional options will be needed based on the provided type. Support types: 'grpc'.


#
# --- Section 4.2: [gRPC Subscriber Settings] ---
#

# The configuration options in this section must be specified under each [[subscriber]] when the
# subscriber's type is set to 'grpc'.

# grpc-address: The IP address or hostname and port of the subscriber. No default.

# grpc-disconnect-timeout: When a local disconnect is requested, how long to wait (in seconds) for
# the remote subscriber to also shutdown their end of the connection before just closing the
# connection. If this value is to short then we may not receive acknowledgement of events the
# subscriber has processed (subscribers should resend the acknowledgement when they reconnect). If
# this value is to long, then reconfiguration attempts or shutting down Watch may hang for an
# inconvenient amount of time. Default: 30 (seconds).

# Using TLS to encrypt events sent to subscribers: Because file system modification events can carry
# potentially sensitive information, it is recommended to use TLS to authenticate subscribers and
# encrypt all communication. If subscribers are configured to use a valid certificate signed by a
# recognized Certificate Authority (CA), or your organization is using its own signing server and
# adding the necessary certificate(s) to the system running Watch, no additional steps will be
# required. If this is not the case there are a few options: 

# grpc-tls-cert-file: Specify the path to a certificate used to verify the identity of the subscriber and
# to encrypt communication. If this parameter is left empty, the application will use the system's
# default certificate pool. This parameter is ignored if tls-disable is set.
# Example: /etc/beegfs/cert.pem

# grpc-tls-disable-verification: Set to true to skip verifying the subscribers TLS certificate. This
# allows traffic to be encrypted, but puts the client at risk of a man-in-the-middle attack since it
# cannot verify the subscriber is the expected one.

# grpc-tls-disable: Set to disable TLS encryption and send all gRPC messages in clear text over the
# network. Discouraged for production as it exposes data to potential interception and tampering.

# grpc-use-http-proxy: Set to automatically use any proxy configured globally or via environment
# variables for gRPC communication to the subscriber.
